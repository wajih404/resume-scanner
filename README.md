# resume-scanner
This project is an AI-assisted resume screening application designed to automate the initial shortlisting stage of hiring. The system parses resumes in PDF and DOCX formats, extracts textual content, and evaluates each resume against a predefined set of role-specific keywords.

Rather than replacing human judgment, the tool is intended to support recruiters and hiring teams by quickly identifying resumes that best align with job requirements, reducing manual effort in early screening stages.

The application is built with Streamlit and focuses on transparency, explainability, and practical usability.
